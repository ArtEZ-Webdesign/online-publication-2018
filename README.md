Semester 1

## Assignment

In your Media Theory classes, you have discussed the concepts of media as extensions of man (McLuhan) and remediation (Bolter and Grusin) and written your own opinion piece on these themes. These themes are still very relevant today in the context of the web: if you see the web as an extension of ourselves, we now have the ability to transfer our thoughts and opinions and broadcast them over the entire world. The web has also created new forms of narration: we are no longer bound to just static imagery or books, but we can create interactive, dynamic, interlinked content that adjusts to the reader.

In this assignment, you will take the texts you have read as well as your opinion piece and present them in a web-based, online publication. You are challenged to translate the concepts in your opinion piece into an interactive publication that can take on any form and audience of your choosing, using modern web techniques. Think about the new ways in which we can consume information on the web and who you want to deliver your content to.

## Goals

-	Using the web as a medium for new forms of storytelling
-	Conceptualising and designing from a basis in media theory
-	Using the knowledge acquired in one class and applying it in another

## Roadmap

The assignment will run for the second half of the first semester. You are invited to schedule your time yourself, taking the texts as a starting point and working towards a functional online publication by the end of the semester.

## Criteria

-	Does it work?
-	How well have you been able to translate your concepts into design?
-	Have you experimented with different web technologies and leveraged their strengths for your publication?
-	How are you publishing your publication?
